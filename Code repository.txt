Nothing fancy just a place to dump code I think I might need at a later date, helps to keep the program unclogged with lines upon lines of commented code!
//some movement code

						case SDLK_w: pModel = glm::translate(pModel, glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.10f, 0.0f));
						std::cout << "W key has been pressed!" << std::endl;
						break;
					case SDLK_s:pModel = glm::translate(pModel, glm::vec3(0.0f, -0.05f, 0.0f));
						break;

SDL Get ticks + print to console
This is useful becaus I'll be honest, I'll probablyt forget it works in miliseconds!

		//prints the time to the console. This was mostly to learn how SDL_GetTicks(); works. Dividing the value by 1000 gives the time in seconds
		// and makes it easier to work with. 
		currentTime = SDL_GetTicks();
		if (currentTime > lastTime + 1000)
		{
			lastTime = lastTime / 1000;
			printf("Seconds Passed is: %d\n", lastTime);
			lastTime = currentTime;
		}
